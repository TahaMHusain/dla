    "There are many definitions of \"signal\" in different areas, but this is not so important to us. Therefore, we will assume that a signal is a description of how one parameter depends on another parameter.  [[Steven W. Smith]](http://www.dspguide.com/ch2/1.htm). The most common type of signal in analog electronics is a voltage that changes over time. Also, for example, seismic vibrations or audio signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in **audio signals**, so it is worthwhile to understand a little about the physics. In short, sound is undulating compressions and rarefactions of air or some other medium. How is sound recorded? We usually plug in a microphone and use it to record something into the computer. So, we have a sound, which is the fluctuation of air pressure. The sound enters the microphone, which is an input transducer, and it converts fluctuations in air pressure into fluctuations in electrical voltage. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the method of setting, signals can be divided into two types:\n",
    "* **Deterministic signals**. They are set using some kind of analytical function.\n",
    "* **Random signals**. They arise from random processes and are not covered in this course :) \n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic signals can be divided into **periodic** and **non-periodic**. Non-periodic signals are usually time limited. \n",
    "A periodic signal is a signal that repeats in time with a certain period $T$, that is, for which the following condition is met: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(t) = f(t + kT), \\: k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, T \\in \\mathbb{R}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a harmonic waveform described as follows: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    f(t) = A \\cos\\Big(\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot t}{T} + \\phi \\Big)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $A$ is the amplitude, $T$ is the period, and $\\phi$ is the phase of the signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at harmonic oscillation in more detail, since this is important for the Fourier transform. "
