    "    Implement a speech classifier for digits based on melspectrograms.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Note:\n",
    "        You should test your implementation with torchaudio functions\n",
    "        (e.g. torch.allclose(torchaudio.transforms.Spectrogram.__call__, your_function))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main rules\n",
    "    1) All operations must be implemented with pytorch (don't use numpy)\n",
    "    2) Everything should support batch input\n",
    "    3) No cycles, only matrix multiplications\n",
    "    4) Clean and clear code "
